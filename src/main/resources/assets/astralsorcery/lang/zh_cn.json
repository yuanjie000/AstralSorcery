  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.3.text": "鉴于其对聚集星能异常敏感，因此可以在晚上用它来找寻冲突的星能共振区域。当在露天的夜晚时，星杖会与区域进行共鸣，星杖的共振频率说明该区域的地下深处含有§3结晶态§r的星能析出。<NL>这些区域在地面上看起来如同星能在地面移动而形成的烟雾弥漫区。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.2.text": "为了让它能吸收星能，需要一个露天的环境。另外，它也缺少聚能水晶那样能够有效防止星能逸散的在充能矩阵，因此星能的逸散是无法避免的。学院的测量结果表明，海平面高度大致是逸散损失的中间点，在基岩层时星能几乎完全逸散了，大气层在高度为海平面的两倍时，将停止逸散。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.4.text": "如果合成台的位置高于大气层，或通过其他方式让其突破大气层高度是无效的，建议将合成台重新放置到其他正常的位置上。星能并非在天空上均匀分布的，部分地区的可用星能量会远超其他地区。值得庆幸的是，星能的总量不会因这类鲁莽的行为而匮乏，并且在所有已知地区，调查组未曾发现有大范围的绝星能区。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.5.text": "在合成台上摆放后制作配方原料的物品后，用共鸣星杖右键单击引导合成台内储存的星能，使其充分与原材料结合。当物品制作完成后会自动从合成台内弹出。当前合成台所储存的星能会显示在合成台界面的下方。由于星能的逸散性，其会以波动状态增减。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.6.text": "这种储存功能不同于电池那样随时间而充能，而是反映当前合成时所有收集到的可用星能总量。除了最简单的设备，工具和材料处理之外，所有这些都将需要合成台提供其内储存的更大量的纯净安全的星能进行重定向。<NL>一旦有提升者用其构建必要的工具继续深入学习时，他们还需要在星能概念上获得足够的知识来改进合成台，提升它的使用效率。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.MARBLETYPES.2.text": "虽然这与学院的公共神殿以及学生聚集区内公用的大理石相同，但学院在此郑重告诫所有提升者，盗窃或破坏学院公共财产大理石的将受到院级处分，严重者甚至将被开除出学院。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SOOTYMARBLE.name": "熏黑大理石",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SOOTYMARBLE.1.text": "把一些神奇的过滤元素（比如煤炭）作为大理石的表面涂层，可以改变大理石的性质，而不仅仅是使其变得“肮脏”。特殊的共振方式已经从根本上改变了大理石的性质，因此即使洗去灰尘也无法改变大理石通过表面吸收和反射特殊能量的性质与新外观。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SOOTYMARBLE.2.text": "在纯化大量星能内蕴含的杂质时是十分有用的，因为在使用星能收集装置吸收星能时是有极大可能吸收到大量的杂质的。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.1.text": "Despite stars having a set location of appearance as they wheel overhead in the sky, certain recurring patterns and shapes will appear to those sensitive to the magical energies emanated by them. These magical constellations have their own schedule they appear within, which is linked to the phases of the moon.

  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.5.text": "Not holding the Looking Glass absolutely still in this way, or without tracing with near perfect accuracy the constellation, the magical pattern will not be truly §3discovered§r.

  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUM_POWDER.1.text": "Glowstone is reactive to Starlight energy, even the small amount resonating within an Aquamarine. By crushing glowstone together with an Aquamarine, the resulting pile of dust is highly reactive with itself.

Deploying Illumination Sparks using a Starlight-powered device is far better. <NL>By powering the device directly from the nighttime Fosic Field, or a more advanced initiate's Illumination Wand, the Cave Illuminator can provide light coverage over a wide area, in spiraling vertical layers 8 meters apart.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATOR.3.text": "To prevent unnecessary placement of Sparks, the Illuminator will only place Sparks in areas lower than the Illuminator itself, and only in places that are covered from the sky. If given sufficient time, it can illuminate all the way down to bedrock, and will continue to place new Sparks in newly made empty spaces. <NL>Removing the Illuminator will leave the Sparks behind.

These variances in size, purity of the crystal, and even shape of the facets can result in considerable differences in suitability for a purpose. There is no method to determine what these attributes will be for any given crystal before freed from its rocky prison, and while the Academy recognizes that modifications to these crystals is an incredibly important part in their use, it is not nearly as simple as shaping a normal gemstone's appearance.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.1.text": "Submerging a Rock Crystal into a pool of Liquid Starlight until absorbed can be used to repair or grow the crystal into a more robust version of itself, as the internal matrix is realigned and reinforced by the magical energies of concentrated Starlight. When this occurs, the Size of the crystal will increase. There are still limits to what any crystal can have an attribute improved to or its number of attributes, and removal of an attribute is not possible without intentional use of a specialized tool.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.2.text": "Submerging two crystals in Liquid Starlight will cause the crystal with fewer attributes to merge into the crystal with more, with the \"larger\" crystal potentially gaining one or more of the attributes of the absorbed crystal.

The resulting crystals will each inherit a portion of their parent's attributes, but the process is neither even nor perfect.

  "astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.1.text": "While particularly vulnerable to shear forces, Rock Crystals can be carefully shaped to channel background Starlight energies to become far more durable than metal tools. By using several crystals to specially craft common tools that channel background Starlight energies, these tools can be crafted to magically leverage the attributes of their component crystals.

This Liquid Starlight has many uses for a sorcerer, but trying to collect the faint amounts that naturally gather on Aquamarine gems or Crystals under normal concentrations is impossible. A special channeling container is needed for gatherering and storing Starlight for accelerated, stable Liquid Starlight collection. The more Starlight that is provided to a Lightwell, the faster it will produce liquid from any given catalyst.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WELL.3.text": "Inserting a catalyst object into the Lightwell using right-click binds it irretrievably to the Lightwell. This catalyst will be slowly degraded by the Starlight power channeled through it, generating liquid until it is disintegrated entirely. While lifespan of a catalyst is variable, larger catalysts will produce more liquid and last longer. Starlight-sensitive Aquamarine and Crystals generate Liquid Starlight, buut other catalysts can be used to generate other liquids, such as lava from netherrack.",

Pipes and pumps that actively draw fluids can remove fluid from a Lightwell using the bottom face, but cannot return fluid back into a Lightwell. <NL>The more Starlight receptivity in a catalyst, the more liquid it will produce. Rock Crystals provide much more than Aquamarines, and enhancing a catalyst with advanced forms will produce more than their base form.",

The Academy recommends having a nearby Collector to transmute the ore again each time this occurs.",
