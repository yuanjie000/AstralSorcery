  "astralsorcery.journal.WELCOME.2.text": "以最适合的进度来适配您的学习需求。<NL>但不要误以为您的学习会很轻松。与其他的学习机构相比，本学院以毕业生的优异成绩而自豪，您需要用宝典来证明对于星能操纵基本原理的了解，才能获准从星能档案中获得更多的资源倾斜。<NL>我们都祝您学习顺利！<NL>——星空学院全体教职员工。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SHRINES.name": "圣陵学院",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.1.text": "该学院认为在建有神殿的地区附近有利于进行精神研究。它们一般有两种变体：内藏有能进行星能操纵的浮动水晶的大型精致神殿和较小型的初学者遗迹。这两种类型的建筑内都存储有一部分的物资，当然其内的物品也会受上个使用该建筑的使用者而有所变化。大型的神殿通常位于没有树木遮挡的空旷区域，比如沙漠或者高山顶部。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.2.text": "大型的神殿内含有可以用于聚焦和操纵星能的标准聚能水晶。所有人都能借此对五大明亮级别的星座之一进行调和共鸣，对于初学者来说在研究方面有极大的助益。<NL>虽然这些水晶本身是完美无瑕的，但它们是重新精制而成的，本质不够纯净，因此不要期望它与那些熟练掌握水晶调制技术者制作的聚能水晶有相同的星能量。这些水晶也因此无法进行性能强化。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.3.text": "作为公共学习工具的浮动水晶周围设置了特殊的力场控制结界以防止提升者取走或修改它们，这保障了该区域所有提升者的重复利用性。<NL>该学院提醒所有提升者，星能是无法穿透所有不透明的固体物质。当学院需要关闭时，会进行顶部覆盖以防止学区受到恶劣天气和敌对生物的影响，如果要使用神殿内部的浮动水晶，记得移除顶部覆盖。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.CPAPER.name": "星图",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.1.text": "在圣陵学院的仓库内可以找到辅助学习用的羊皮纸。这些羊皮纸与现有的星能档案相匹配，会在使用者首次观看的时候检测相关的档案记录来生成星图，只要对星能概念有足够的了解就会揭示出有关其他星座的知识。因此，不会给如何提升者生成重复的记录。多余的物资应留给其他提升者。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.3.text": "按住Shift的同时打开宝典，可以将这些星图存储在宝典中方便之后进行参考。<NL>若有提升者因失误而丢失星图，学院将不会重新发放这些资料。不过，可以向其他提升者借取一份副本，或者在可以使用更高级的合成祭坛的时候手工重新将星座知识拓印到羊皮纸内。对于如此重大的过失来说是相对较小的代价。提升者可以从任意宝典内查看存储的星图。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.WAND.name": "共鸣星杖",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.1.text": "多亏了学院的养护，浮动水晶会自动将星能洒落到附近的合成台上，其他聚能水晶可以做不到。但这种行为也会产生大量的星能浪费与奇异的混乱，因此无法用于更精巧的工艺上。任何提升者获得的第一个工具必是共鸣星杖，该星杖可以通过右键控制星能从星能感应装置以及特制工具的释放。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.3.text": "鉴于其对聚集星能异常敏感，因此可以在晚上用它来找寻冲突的星能共振区域。当在露天的夜晚时，星杖会与区域进行共鸣，星杖的共振频率说明该区域的地下深处含有§3结晶态§r的星能析出。<NL>这些区域在地面上看起来如同星能在地面移动而形成的烟雾弥漫区。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.4.text": "共鸣星杖的另一个作用是激活那些需要复杂结构运行的星能装置，如果结构错误，它会在异常的星能中断区突出显示，提醒使用者尽快排除故障问题。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ORES.name": "矿物",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ORES.1.text": "§8§n水晶石矿石：§r 在基岩附近的地下深处，因高压而形成的极其稀有且脆弱的晶体。这些晶体具有独特的晶胞结构，这使其对于星能十分敏感。尽管这些晶体本质十分脆弱，但它们被固定在坚硬的岩石层中，必须用坚固的工具（比如钻石）才能进行开采，否则会破坏其内脆弱的晶体。手持共鸣星杖时能够直视星能共振场。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ORES.2.text": "当靠近这些晶体沉积物时，可以通过发光的异常星能点找到它们进行挖掘。<NL>§9§n海蓝宝石砂岩：§r 受沿河岸与海滩上连续不断的水流长久的冲刷而沉积的零散晶体，这些晶体在受到持续的低能星辉照射下产生了应激反应，这形成了一种十分适合星能合成上的自然转化的资源。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ALTAR1.name": "星辉合成台",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.1.text": "星能的纯净度很容易根据材料的属性重新调整为有序纯净状态来达到预期目的。在圣陵学院的浮动聚能水晶附近放一个合成台，力场控制结界将星能重定向，把合成台转化为适合提升者使用的合成工具。这款入门级的合成台采用最纯净的大理石制成，可以将天空中或聚能水晶内的纯净星能过滤吸收，将其重定向到放置在其内的合成材料上，而不必依赖那混乱而无法控制的能量脉冲上。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.2.text": "为了让它能吸收星能，需要一个露天的环境。另外，它也缺少聚能水晶那样能够有效防止星能逸散的在充能矩阵，因此星能的逸散是无法避免的。学院的测量结果表明，海平面高度大致是逸散损失的中间点，在基岩层时星能几乎完全逸散了，大气层在高度为海平面的两倍时，将停止逸散。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.4.text": "如果合成台的位置高于大气层，或通过其他方式让其突破大气层高度是无效的，建议将合成台重新放置到其他正常的位置上。星能并非在天空上均匀分布的，部分地区的可用星能量会远超其他地区。值得庆幸的是，星能的总量不会因这类鲁莽的行为而匮乏，并且在所有已知地区，调查组未曾发现有大范围的绝星能区。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.5.text": "在合成台上摆放后制作配方原料的物品后，用共鸣星杖右键单击引导合成台内储存的星能，使其充分与原材料结合。当物品制作完成后会自动从合成台内弹出。当前合成台所储存的星能会显示在合成台界面的下方。由于星能的逸散性，其会以波动状态增减。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.6.text": "这种储存功能不同于电池那样随时间而充能，而是反映当前合成时所有收集到的可用星能总量。除了最简单的设备，工具和材料处理之外，所有这些都将需要合成台提供其内储存的更大量的纯净安全的星能进行重定向。<NL>一旦有提升者用其构建必要的工具继续深入学习时，他们还需要在星能概念上获得足够的知识来改进合成台，提升它的使用效率。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.MARBLETYPES.name": "大理石",
  "astralsorcery.journal.MARBLETYPES.1.text": "星辉法师需要的是一种特别纯净的特种大理石。可以在地下的洞穴中找到这种具有独特的奇妙质感且能对星能进行高度反射的大理石。至于其他的低纯度大理石，由于无法进行更细致的能量控制，是无法与星能进行交感作用的。以特定的雕琢方式改变大理石的纹理，会改变大理石控制附近星能的渠道。<NL>",
  "astralsorcery.journal.MARBLETYPES.2.text": "虽然这与学院的公共神殿以及学生聚集区内公用的大理石相同，但学院在此郑重告诫所有提升者，盗窃或破坏学院公共财产大理石的将受到院级处分，严重者甚至将被开除出学院。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SOOTYMARBLE.name": "熏黑大理石",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SOOTYMARBLE.1.text": "把一些神奇的过滤元素（比如煤炭）作为大理石的表面涂层，可以改变大理石的性质，而不仅仅是使其变得“肮脏”。特殊的共振方式已经从根本上改变了大理石的性质，因此即使洗去灰尘也无法改变大理石通过表面吸收和反射特殊能量的性质与新外观。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SOOTYMARBLE.2.text": "在纯化大量星能内蕴含的杂质时是十分有用的，因为在使用星能收集装置吸收星能时是有极大可能吸收到大量的杂质的。",



  "astralsorcery.journal.node.HAND_TELESCOPE.name": "望远镜",
  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.1.text": "尽管星体在星空中不断的在移动，但仍然会显示出特定的位置。对于那些星能敏感者而言，则能感应到某些重复出现的图案与形状中蕴含的特殊能量。这些奇特的星座的运动规律与月相有关。可以使用一种特制的玻璃镜片使观察者更清楚的对它们进行观测。虽然望远镜是最基础的观测设备，但它仍能提高你对星空的观测效率，",
  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.4.text": "不过受其他星座的能量干扰，每个夜晚，望远镜只能对一个星座进行观测。<NL>观测时必须保证周围没有任何的障碍物，并且要发现过对应星座的星图才行。更重要的是，但你发现了星座需要进行绘制时，按住shift固定望远镜，然后用左键对星座的图案进行详细的测绘。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.5.text": "如果没有对望远镜进行固定，或没有准确的绘制出星座的话，是无法§3发现§r它们的。一旦完成星座的绘制，其将永久固化在脑海里，星座中的强大能量让你从此以后再也无需任何设备就能再夜空中看到它。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ILLUM_POWDER.name": "辉光粉",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUM_POWDER.1.text": "荧石对星能也是有反应的，即使与微量的海蓝宝石接触也会发生明显的共振现象。把海蓝宝石与荧石磨碎的粉末混合在一起，它们之间会产生剧烈的高能反应。将这种粉末扔出会在空间中形成一个光源。<NL>其本质就是一团漂浮的粉尘，在不知情的情况下，不会像火把一样熄灭，要做到这点需要用液体或方块对其进行覆盖。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.NOC_POWDER.name": "暗夜粉",
  "astralsorcery.journal.NOC_POWDER.1.text": "虽然暗室是一般情况下强制怪物生成并收割它们身上贵重器官的正常方式，但暗室除了没有光线的要求外，还有严格的后勤要求。<NL>通过利用辉光粉内的星能与其他活性成分来产生抑光区域，这就制作出了一个可投掷的，生成临时的黑暗云区域的粉末，",
  "astralsorcery.journal.NOC_POWDER.3.text": "该区域会在短时间内根据生物群系的反应生成相应的怪物，无论它们是如何的稀有少见。<NL>这片区域不会影响阳光对怪物的净化效果，因此应注意不要赶走或过早击杀其中的一些怪物。<NL>将多个云区放置的太近或太频繁的在同一个位置释放，会降低怪物的生成几率。无论是由你自己还是投掷器扔出的。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ILLUMINATOR.name": "洞穴照明器",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATOR.1.text": "辉光粉无法应付大范围的区域照明问题。这不仅仅是需要手动部署的问题，还需要亲身进入危险区域。使用由星能驱动的设备来部署光源会好很多。<NL>通过吸收夜间的聚能场或使用其他提升者的照明星杖为装置供能，洞穴照明器可以在8米范围的螺旋形垂直层中提供广阔的照明范围。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATOR.3.text": "为了防止光源过多的问题，洞穴照明器只会在其下方的洞穴区域放置光源。如果有足够的时间，它将一直照亮到基岩层，并将继续在新出现的空白区域放置光源。<NL>拆除洞穴照明器时光源会保留。毕竟清楚光源是十分费力的工作，因此放置时请注意，以防止照亮不需要的区域。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ROCK_CRYSTALS.name": "水晶石的属性",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ROCK_CRYSTALS.1.text": "由于产生它们的特殊环境，每种新开采的水晶石都是不同的。在尺寸、纯度与可塑性上的差异，都会导致对特定用途的适用性存在相当大的差异。在把它们从岩石层中挖掘出来前，没有如何办法可以确定这些水晶石的具体属性。虽然学院早已认知到对水晶石的修正是利用水晶石的必经之路，但这可不像给一个普通宝石整容那么简单。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ROCK_CRYSTALS.2.text": "将水晶石用砂轮粗暴的打磨只会造成破坏。因此需要用更优雅的方式对水晶进行§8修正§r。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.name": "水晶的修正",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.1.text": "基于内部矩阵基质受星能影响而进行强化重构的原理，将水晶石浸没在星能液中，直到星能液被吸收掉，可以修复或者让水晶石变得更坚固耐用。当发生这种情况时，水晶石的尺寸将增长。但任何水晶石的属性修正与属性数量的修正都有其极限，若不使用专用工具是无法删除水晶石上的属性的。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.2.text": "将两个晶体浸入星能液中会导致属性较少的水晶石被合并到具有更多属性的水晶石中，“较大”的水晶石可能获得被吸收的水晶石的一个或多个属性。水晶石拥有的属性越多，发生这种情况的可能性就越小。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.CUTTING_TOOL.name": "星辉锭切削工具",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CUTTING_TOOL.1.text": "学院文献表明，虽然铁或钢凿子是一种很好的工具，但它仅是物理上的，而引导星能则完全相反，仅是魔法上的。将星辉锭的坚固特性与能量辐射场相结合，可以同时影响两种形态。金可以防止凿头的星能场变形，强化工具。<NL>对工具进行附魔将获得更好的保护，以防产生负面影响。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CUTTING_TOOL.3.text": "用工具敲击水晶石，可以分割水晶石以及其属性。新生成的水晶石将各自继承其父代属性的一部分，但这个过程既不均匀也不完美。有时还会导致部分属性消失。<NL>不断的将水晶石和雕凿出的碎片浸没在星能液中，再花费些时间，可以塑造出一个特定用途的水晶石，当然，这需要一些§5运气§r才行。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.TOOLS.name": "水晶石工具",
  "astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.1.text": "尽管特别容易受剪切应力影响，但精心特制的水晶石在导引背景星能时的性能要远远优于金属工具。使用多个水晶石专门制作的普通工具导引背景星能时，可以充分地利用其组成的水晶石所具有的属性并完美发挥出来。用这种方式制作的工具将拥有独特的作用，即使是同一为制作者所制造的工具也有可能因为所使用的水晶石而拥有完全不同的强度与能力。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.3.text": "可以将损坏的工具浸入星能液中，让其吸收星能液来恢复耐久。<NL>一些博学多识的提升者甚至可以找到在使用过程中为这些工具提供外部星能的方法，来进一步增强它们的功能，或以其他的方式利用它们的属性。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.WELL.name": "聚星缸",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WELL.1.text": "水晶石周围会自然而然的聚集星能，将其放置在高浓度的星能下时，其周围会生成露珠状的星能凝结液。这种液态的星能对于魔法研究上有极大的助益，但正常情况下是无法收集海蓝宝石或水晶石周围自然凝结的微量液体的。需要用一个特制的导引容器来收集与存储星能，以更加快速稳定的方式收集星能液。提供给聚星缸的星能越多，它利用催化剂产生星能液的速度就越快。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WELL.3.text": "使用鼠标右键将催化剂放入聚星缸后，催化剂将无法取下。催化剂将被周围的星能缓慢降解，并不断生成星能液，直到它完全分解为止。虽然催化剂的使用寿命都不同，但越大份量的催化剂产生的星能液越多，其寿命也越长。对星能敏感的海蓝宝石和水晶石可以产生星能液，但是其他催化剂也可以产生其他液体，比如用下界岩产生熔岩。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WELL.4.text": "由于其独特的构造限制，即使有外部的星能源进行供能，聚星缸正上方的位置也必须保持露天。从聚星缸的底部可以用抽取液体的泵或管道来提前液体，但无法将液体回流到聚星缸内。<NL>催化剂对星能的感应越强，它产生的液体就越多。水晶石就比海蓝宝石要产生更多的星能液，以更高级的方式强化的催化剂会比其基础形式产生更多的产物。",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WELL.5.text": "星能液在星能合成外也有其他的用途。它的流动速度比水更快，触碰它会获得暂时的夜视能力，它也与其他液体发生交互作用。这种超冷流体会立即冻结与之接触的所有水，并迅速冷却流动的熔岩，以至于形成的是沙子而不是石头。<NL>有时形成沙子时受环境的星能影响生成海蓝宝石砂岩。",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.INFUSED_WOOD.name": "聚星木",
